# Applying Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in C++

## What is SRP?
The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** states that a class should have only **one reason to change**.
This ensures better maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

## How This Code Follows SRP:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Product Class (Single Responsibility: Represents a Product)
- Stores product details (name & price).
- Does **not** handle storage or retrieval.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ProductCatalog Class (Single Responsibility: Manages Product Storage)
- Stores products in a catalog.
- Allows retrieval of product prices.
- Handles product availability checks.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Order Class (Single Responsibility: Handles Order Management)
- Creates orders.
- Stores ordered items.
- Does **not** validate or process payments.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ PaymentProcessor Class (Single Responsibility: Handles Payments)
- Calculates total order price.
- Processes payment.
- Does **not** modify orders or validate them.

## Advantages of SRP in this Code:
‚úÖ Improved Maintainability ‚Üí Each class has a clear role.  
‚úÖ Scalability ‚Üí Easy to extend functionality without breaking existing code.  
‚úÖ Better Readability ‚Üí Each class is easy to understand and debug.  
‚úÖ Reduced Dependencies ‚Üí No unnecessary coupling between unrelated tasks.  

## üöÄ Execution:
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o program
./program
```

### **Benefits of This SRP Refactor:**
1. **Each class has a single responsibility.**  
2. **Modifications to one part don‚Äôt affect others.**  
3. **Easier debugging and testing.**  
4. **Better separation of concerns.**
